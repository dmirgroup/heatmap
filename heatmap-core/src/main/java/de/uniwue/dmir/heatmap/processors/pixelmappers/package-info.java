package de.uniwue.dmir.heatmap.processors.pixelmappers;

/**
 * <p>The <code>pixelmappers</code> package contains classes to map 
 * pixels of a tile to the information needed by 
 * {@link de.uniwue.dmir.heatmap.core.ITileProcessor}s and
 * {@link de.uniwue.dmir.heatmap.core.IFilter}s.
 * This makes processors and filters applicable to a larger variety of tile and 
 * pixel types.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Note that a tile does not necessarily consist of pixels (but does 
 * most of the time).
 * Thus, this abstraction is only applicable if tiles consist of pixels.</p>
